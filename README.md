This website is a part of E-commerce whose purpose is to buy and sell goods and services, over a network, primarily the internet. In our case, the business that we are venturing is E-Commerce about Computer, Computer Components, Peripherals, and anything that is related to computer (CCTV, Sound Cards, etc.)
The proprietors manage to publish this online by using a free web hosting site Heroku. By doing so, the publishers manage to do real-time updating in the database and in the main site. The project has two parts (website): the Admin Site and the Main Site).
The Admin site (pcmastershop.herokuapp.com/admin/signup) is where Content Specialists adds products and other contents that will be saved in the database. The contents of the database will later used and integrate to the main site.
The Main site (pcmastershop.herokuapp.com/) is where the customer can see the products, avail and transact, and a feature called “add to cart” where the user can “save” that product and order it in some time.
